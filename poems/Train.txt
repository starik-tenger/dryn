Train was running through the wild,
Crossing field with bulls and cows.
Driver is pushing levers tight,
Ready to go forward now.

Making loud creaky sound,
Train is going to turn.
Suddenly it's going down.
Iron axis had a tear.

Locomotive fell to ground,
And the wagons joined it then.
Death is comming all around.
Train have turned into Hell.

In the overturned wagons
Dead men everywhere lie.
Only few survivors there
Try to go to the light.

Outside is field, it's wild.
Amok bulls are walking there,
Don't controll their own mind,
Trampling all and everywhere.
